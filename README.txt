This is the first part of the Up Spark! Arduino course.

This course is designed to demonstrate one of the most effective methods to make an expandable audio synthesiser using Arduino.

It is for beginners who would like to get into software programming, IC programming and audio. 

It is also aimed at people who know the basics of programming but would like to investigate alternate methodologies to programming without having to decipher hundreds of lines of code.

The lessons start out and try to remain very basic, explaining the advantages and flaws of each method used to help readers understand exactly how each line of code works. Each lesson builds on the last, so feel free to start at the last and work backwards when you're stuck, or just start at the beginning and follow along.

To do each lesson:
1, View the JPG files in the main folder on how to set up your circuit on a breadboard. (The loudspeaker in the diagram can be any sort of audio device. Headphones work best, but you may need to fashion some kind of audio jack for this)
2, Download and install the relevant software for your arduino from the arduino website.
3, Download or read the code from this github project, type it, compile it. (We recommend manually typing it as it helps you to remember what each bit does)
4, Compile and run your code!
5, Play around with the code to see what effect it has on your output.
